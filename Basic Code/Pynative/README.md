## General
Each excercise is a separate def insire .py file (those are too basic to separate)

## Excercises

### Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers
Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000, else return their sum.

<b> Expected Output </b>
number1 = 20
number2 = 30
The result is 600

number1 = 40
number2 = 30
The result is 70

### Exercise 2: Print the sum of the current number and the previous number
Write a program to iterate the first x numbers and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

<b> Expected Output </b>
Printing current and previous number sum in a range(10)
Current Number 0 Previous Number  0  Sum:  0
Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17

### Exercise 3: Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number
Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number.

For example, str = "pynative" so you should display ‘p’, ‘n’, ‘t’, ‘v’.

<b> Expected Output </b>
Orginal String is  pynative
Printing only even index chars
p
n
t
v

### Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string
Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.
Note: n must be less than the length of the string.

<b> Expected Output </b>
remove_chars("pynative", 4) so output must be tive. Here we need to remove first four characters from a string.
remove_chars("pynative", 2) so output must be native. Here we need to remove first two characters from a string.



### Exercise 5: Check if the first and last number of a list is the same
Write a function to return True if the first and last number of a given list is same. If numbers are different then return False.

<b> Expected Output </b>
Given:

numbers_x = [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
numbers_y = [75, 65, 35, 75, 30]
Expected Output:

Given list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
result is True

numbers_y = [75, 65, 35, 75, 30]
result is False

### Exercise 6: Display numbers divisible by 5 from a list
Exercise 6: Display numbers divisible by 5 from a list
<b> Expected Output </b>
Given list is  [10, 20, 33, 46, 55]
Divisible by 5
10
20
55

### Exercise 7: Return the count of a given substring from a string
Write a program to find how many times substring “Emma” appears in the given string.

<b> Expected Output </b>
Given:

str_x = "Emma is good developer. Emma is a writer"
Expected Output:

Emma appeared 2 times

### Exercise 8: Print the following pattern

<b> Expected Output </b>
1 
2 2 
3 3 3 
4 4 4 4 
5 5 5 5 5

### Exercise 9: Check Palindrome Number
Write a program to check if the given number is a palindrome number.

A palindrome number is a number that is same after reverse. For example 545, is the palindrome numbers

<b> Expected Output </b>
original number 121
Yes. given number is palindrome number

original number 125
No. given number is not palindrome number
